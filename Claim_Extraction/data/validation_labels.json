Among the non-Typhi Salmonella isolates, azithromycin MICs among human isolates ranged from 1 to 32 \u03bcg/ml, whereas the MICs among the animal and retail meat isolates ranged from 2 to 16 \u03bcg/ml and 4 to 16 \u03bcg/ml, respectively. Among Salmonella serotype Typhi isolates, the azithromycin MICs ranged from 4 to 16 \u03bcg/ml.

Exploring the evolutionary pathway of SEFIR domains will provide further insight into their functions. Here, we have identified 84 SEFIR domain-containing proteins from more than 1400 prokaryotic genomes. As most SEFIR domain-containing bacterial genomes possess a single SEFIR encoding gene and the SEFIR protein domain forms homodimeric complexes like the Toll/IL1 receptor (TIR) domain, the single bacterial SEFIR proteins may receive binding partners from other organisms.

Microorganisms, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, remain active within brine channels inside the ice, making it unnecessary to penetrate through to liquid water below in order to detect life. We have developed a submersible digital holographic microscope (DHM) that is capable of resolving individual bacterial cells, and demonstrated its utility for immediately imaging samples taken directly from sea ice at several locations near Nuuk, Greenland. In all samples, the appearance and motility of eukaryotes were conclusive signs of life. The appearance of prokaryotic cells alone was not sufficient to confirm life, but when prokaryotic motility occurred, it was rapid and conclusive.

SidM is the only known protein that catalyzes both the exchange of GDP for GTP and GDI displacement from small GTPase Rab1. We determined the crystal structures of SidM alone (residues 317-647) and SidM (residues 193-550) in complex with nucleotide-free WT Rab1. The SidM structure contains an N-terminal helical domain with a potential new function, a Rab1-activation domain, and a C-terminal phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-binding P4M domain. The Rab1-activation domain has extensive strong interactions mainly with Rab1 switch I and II regions that undergo substantial conformational changes on SidM binding. Mutations of switch-contacting residues in SidM attenuate both the nucleotide exchange and GDI displacement activities. Structural comparisons of Rab1 in the SidM complex with Rab1-GDP and Ypt1-GDP in the GDI complex identify key conformational changes that disrupt the nucleotide and GDI binding of Rab1. Further biochemical and structural analyses reveal a unique mechanism of coupled GDP release and GDI displacement likely triggered by the SidM-induced drastic displacement of switch I of Rab1.", "journal": "Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America", "sentences": ["Bacterial pathogens deliver effector proteins with diverse biochemical activities into host cells, thereby modulating various host functions.", "Legionella pneumophila hijacks host vesicle trafficking to avoid phagosome-lysosome fusion, a mechanism that is dependent on the Legionella Dot/Icm type IV secretion system.", "SidM/DrrA, a Legionella type IV effector, is important for the interactions of Legionella-containing vacuoles with host endoplasmic reticulum-derived vesicles.", "SidM is the only known protein that catalyzes both the exchange of GDP for GTP and GDI displacement from small GTPase Rab1.", "We determined the crystal structures of SidM alone (residues 317-647) and SidM (residues 193-550) in complex with nucleotide-free WT Rab1.", "The SidM structure contains an N-terminal helical domain with a potential new function, a Rab1-activation domain, and a C-terminal phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate-binding P4M domain.", "The Rab1-activation domain has extensive strong interactions mainly with Rab1 switch I and II regions that undergo substantial conformational changes on SidM binding.", "Mutations of switch-contacting residues in SidM attenuate both the nucleotide exchange and GDI displacement activities.", "Structural comparisons of Rab1 in the SidM complex with Rab1-GDP and Ypt1-GDP in the GDI complex identify key conformational changes that disrupt the nucleotide and GDI binding of Rab1.", "Further biochemical and structural analyses reveal a unique mechanism of coupled GDP release and GDI displacement likely triggered by the SidM-induced drastic displacement of switch I of Rab1."], "title": "Structural mechanism of host Rab1 activation by the bifunctional Legionella type IV effector SidM/DrrA."}

This interaction is required for late endosomal trafficking of the L2 protein and entry of the L2/DNA complex into the nucleus during infection. Here we show an interaction between papillomavirus L2 proteins and the related PX-FERM family member sorting nexin 27 (SNX27), which is mediated in part by a novel interaction between the PDZ domain of SNX27 and sequences in a central portion of L2. The interaction is direct and, unlike that with SNX17, is variable in strength depending on the papillomavirus type. We show that small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of SNX27 alone leads to a marginal reduction in the efficiency of viral infection but that double knockdown of both sorting nexins results in a striking reduction in infection, greater than that observed for the knockdown of either sorting nexin alone. These results suggest that the HPV L2 proteins can interact through distinct mechanisms with multiple components of the cellular cargo-sorting machinery.\n\n\nIMPORTANCE\nThe trafficking of papillomaviruses to the host cell nucleus during their natural infectious life cycle is an incompletely understood process.

Its ubiquitin-binding activity is confined to an N-terminal Pru (pleckstrin-like receptor for ubiquitin) domain that also docks it into the proteasome, while its C-terminal DEUBAD (DEUBiquitinase ADaptor) domain recruits deubiquitinating enzyme Uch37 to the proteasome. Bis-benzylidine piperidone derivatives that were found to bind covalently to Rpn13 C88 caused the accumulation of polyubiquitinated proteins as well as ER stress-related apoptosis in various cancer cell lines, including bortezomib-resistant multiple myeloma lines. We find that a 38-amino acid peptide derived from the C-terminus of proteasome PC repeat protein hRpn2/PSMD1 binds to hRpn13 Pru domain with 12 nM affinity. By using NMR, we identify the hRpn13-interacting amino acids in this hRpn2 fragment, some of which are conserved among eukaryotes. Importantly, we find the hRpn2-derived peptide to immunoprecipitate endogenous Rpn13 from 293T cells, and to displace it from the proteasome. These findings indicate that this region of hRpn2 is the primary binding site for hRpn13 in the proteasome.

Yet such summer insolation is near to its minimum at present, and there are no signs of a new ice age. This challenges our understanding of the mechanisms driving glacial cycles and our ability to predict the next glacial inception. Here we propose a critical functional relationship between boreal summer insolation and global carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration, which explains the beginning of the past eight glacial cycles and might anticipate future periods of glacial inception. Using an ensemble of simulations generated by an Earth system model of intermediate complexity constrained by palaeoclimatic data, we suggest that glacial inception was narrowly missed before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. The missed inception can be accounted for by the combined effect of relatively high late-Holocene CO2 concentrations and the low orbital eccentricity of the Earth. Additionally, our analysis suggests that even in the absence of human perturbations no substantial build-up of ice sheets would occur within the next several thousand years and that the current interglacial would probably last for another 50,000 years.

To prove that mecC is the genetic determinant that confers methicillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, a mecC knockout strain was generated.

Using various shRNAs for proof of concept, we validate that coexpression of TuDs can sequester and inactivate shRNA sense strands in human cells selectively without affecting desired antisense activities from the same shRNAs. Moreover, we show how coexpressed TuDs can alleviate shRNA-mediated perturbation of global gene expression by specifically de-repressing off-target transcripts carrying seed matches to the shRNA sense strand.

The most significant risk factor in AD is advanced age and an important neuropathological correlate of AD is the deposition of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta40 and Abeta42) in the brain. An AD-like dementia is also common in older individuals with Down syndrome (DS), though with a much earlier onset. We have shown that somatic mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region (CR) mutations accumulate with age in post-mitotic tissues including the brain and that the level of mtDNA mutations is markedly elevated in the brains of AD patients. The elevated mtDNA CR mutations in AD brains are associated with a reduction in the mtDNA copy number and in the mtDNA L-strand transcript levels. We now show that mtDNA CR mutations increase with age in control brains; that they are markedly elevated in the brains of AD and DS and dementia (DSAD) patients; and that the increased mtDNA CR mutation rate in DSAD brains is associated with reduced mtDNA copy number and L-strand transcripts.

To define the biological functions of miR-142, which is preferentially and abundantly expressed in immune cells, we created a mouse line with a targeted deletion of this gene. Our analysis of miR-142(-/-) mice revealed a critical role for this miRNA in the development and homeostasis of lymphocytes. Marginal zone B cells expand in the knockout spleen, whereas the number of T and B1 B cells in the periphery is reduced.

Trx provides reducing equivalents for central metabolic enzymes and is implicated in redox regulation of a wide number of target proteins, including transcription factors.

In young, healthy individuals, CD8+CCR7+ Tregs are localized in T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs, suppress activation and expansion of CD4 T cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of membrane-proximal signaling molecules, and effectively inhibit proliferative expansion of CD4 T cells in vitro and in vivo. We identified deficiency of NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) as the molecular underpinning of CD8 Treg failure in the older individuals and in patients with giant cell arteritis.

However, other studies have reported loss of EphB4 suggesting a tumor suppressor function in some cancers. These opposing roles may be regulated by (i) the presence of the primary ligand ephrin-B2 that regulates pathways involved in tumor suppression or (ii) the absence of ephrin-B2 that allows EphB4 signaling via ligand-independent pathways that contribute to tumor promotion. To explore this theory, EphB4 was overexpressed in the prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1 and the mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A. Overexpressed EphB4 localized to lipid-rich regions of the plasma membrane and confirmed to be ligand-responsive as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and internalization. EphB4 overexpressing cells demonstrated enhanced anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion, all characteristics associated with an aggressive phenotype, and therefore supporting the hypothesis that overexpressed EphB4 facilitates tumor promotion. Importantly, these effects were reversed in the presence of ephrin-B2 which led to a reduction in EphB4 protein levels, demonstrating that ligand-dependent signaling is tumor suppressive. Furthermore, extended ligand stimulation caused a significant decrease in proliferation that correlated with a rise in caspase-3/7 and -8 activities. Together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of EphB4 confers a transformed phenotype in the case of MCF-10A cells and an increased metastatic phenotype in the case of 22Rv1 cancer cells and that both phenotypes can be restrained by stimulation with ephrin-B2, in part by reducing EphB4 levels.", "journal": "International journal of cancer", "sentences": ["Overexpression of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphB4 is common in epithelial cancers and linked to tumor progression by promoting angiogenesis, increasing survival and facilitating invasion and migration.", "However, other studies have reported loss of EphB4 suggesting a tumor suppressor function in some cancers.", "These opposing roles may be regulated by (i) the presence of the primary ligand ephrin-B2 that regulates pathways involved in tumor suppression or (ii) the absence of ephrin-B2 that allows EphB4 signaling via ligand-independent pathways that contribute to tumor promotion.", "To explore this theory, EphB4 was overexpressed in the prostate cancer cell line 22Rv1 and the mammary epithelial cell line MCF-10A.", "Overexpressed EphB4 localized to lipid-rich regions of the plasma membrane and confirmed to be ligand-responsive as demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and internalization.", "EphB4 overexpressing cells demonstrated enhanced anchorage-independent growth, migration and invasion, all characteristics associated with an aggressive phenotype, and therefore supporting the hypothesis that overexpressed EphB4 facilitates tumor promotion.", "Importantly, these effects were reversed in the presence of ephrin-B2 which led to a reduction in EphB4 protein levels, demonstrating that ligand-dependent signaling is tumor suppressive.", "Furthermore, extended ligand stimulation caused a significant decrease in proliferation that correlated with a rise in caspase-3/7 and -8 activities.", "Together, these results demonstrate that overexpression of EphB4 confers a transformed phenotype in the case of MCF-10A cells and an increased metastatic phenotype in the case of 22Rv1 cancer cells and that both phenotypes can be restrained by stimulation with ephrin-B2, in part by reducing EphB4 levels."], "title": "Evidence for a dual function of EphB4 as tumor promoter and suppressor regulated by the absence or presence of the ephrin-B2 ligand."}
